I'm an executive partner at a B2B software company focused on logistics automation, with over 9 years of experience across technology, product, and finance.

I work at the intersection of software engineering, strategic management, and digital transformation — from scalable system architecture to leading multidisciplinary teams.

I have a continuous interest in initiatives that use technology to solve real problems with scale and impact — whether leading complex technical operations or collaborating with entrepreneurs in building robust and sustainable digital products.

## The Journey

My entry into [Cyberlog](https://www.cyberlog.net), a logistics software company co-founded by my father, was unexpected. After his death in an accident, I inherited a minority stake at a critical moment due to my father playing key roles in the company.

I started as a trainee developer, but quickly after a second crisis in which the company had negative cash flow for the first time in its history, I was called upon by the partners to take over financial management.

I pursued education and knowledge in management, and what could have been just a forced transition became an opportunity for restructuring. I established financial governance — income statements, cash flow statements, budgets..., led complex corporate processes — including valuation, negotiation of partner exits and entries, elimination of operational bottlenecks, and redefinition of strategic direction with support from external consulting.

In the following years, as the company grew, I also took on leadership of the technology sector with the challenge of implementing more efficient work management for the development team and transforming our products to be fully prepared for the web and the cloud.

## Today

As Head of Finance and Technology, I lead a multidisciplinary team of over 10 people across development, support, and administration.

We have implemented agile methodologies with predictable deliveries, a hybrid and distributed work model, as well as a structured people development processes (career plans, continuous feedback, evaluations).

We are transforming how we develop software, implementing end-to-end: DevOps processes, automated testing, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure and proactive monitoring. We have migrated critical services from on-premise environments to the cloud, redesigned the CyberlogWMS architecture, and started building a new web native application that will progressively replace the legacy system.
