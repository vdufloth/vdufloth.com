I'm an executive partner at a B2B software company focused on logistics automation, with over 9 years of experience across technology, product, and finance.

I work at the intersection of software engineering, strategic management, and digital transformation — from scalable system architecture to leading multidisciplinary teams.

I have a continuous interest in initiatives that use technology to solve real problems with scale and impact — whether leading complex technical operations or collaborating with entrepreneurs in building robust and sustainable digital products. More on: [About me]({{<relref "about.md" >}}).
